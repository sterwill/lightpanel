# Overview

A program for the Roku digital video player that shows you 
blinking lights on old computers.  Makes a _great_ screensaver!

This program isn't in the Roku Channel Store, so you'll have to 
install it on your (developer mode) Roku device.  See the 
instructions in the `roku` subdirectory, it's pretty easy to do.

The program cycles through several light animations
(random fast, random slow, binary counter, left-to-right).
Adding new animations to the source code is pretty easy if
you've ever written code before.

The program doesn't use the network when it runs.  All the images
are packaged with the application.

# Requirements

Sorry SDTV viewers, Light Panel HD only works when your Roku is in
the 16:9 display mode.  See `roku/README.md` for the reasons
why.

Light Panel HD requires a Roku 2, Roku XDS, or Roku XR
(or presumably any newer generation), because the images
make it too large to fit on a Roku 1 (which has a application
size limit of 768,000 bytes).

# Screenshots

It's really too bad you can't see the lights blinking in these
images.  You'll just have to install it to see it in action.
