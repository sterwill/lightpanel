# Overview

An app for the Roku digital video player that shows you 
blinking lights on old computers.  Can be configured as a
screensaver.

The program cycles through several light animations
(random fast, random slow, binary counter, left-to-right)
and adding new animations to the source code is pretty easy.

The program has no network dependencies.  All the images
are packaged with the application.

# Screenshots

It's too bad you can't see the lights blinking in these
images, you'll have to install the program to your Roku
to see it in action.

# Requirements

The application requires a Roku 2, Roku XDS, or Roku XR
(or presumably any newer generation), because the images
make it too large to fit on a Roku 1 (which has a application
size limit of 768,000 bytes).
