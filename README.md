# Overview

A program for the Roku digital video player that shows you 
blinking lights on old computers.  Makes a _great_ screensaver!

This program isn't in the Roku Channel Store, so you'll have to 
install it on your (developer mode) Roku device.  See the 
instructions in the `roku` subdirectory, it's pretty easy to do.

The program cycles through several light animations
(random fast, random slow, binary counter, left-to-right).
Adding new animations to the source code is pretty easy if
you've ever written code before.

The program has no network dependencies.  All the images
are packaged with the application.

# Screenshots

It's too bad you can't see the lights blinking in these
images, you'll have to install the program to see it in
action.

# Requirements

Sorry SDTV viewers, Light Panel HD only works when your Roku is in
the 16:9 display mode.  See `roku/README.md` for the reasons
why.

Light Panel HD requires a Roku 2, Roku XDS, or Roku XR
(or presumably any newer generation), because the images
make it too large to fit on a Roku 1 (which has a application
size limit of 768,000 bytes).
